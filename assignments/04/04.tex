\subsection*{16-1 Coin Changing}
\large{Consider the problem of making change for $n$ cents using the fewest
number of coins. Assume that each coin's value is an integer.}
\\\\
\noindent \large{\textbf{a} \mdseries Describe a greedy algorithm to make
change consisting of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. Prove that your
algorithm yields an optimal solution.}

\subsubsection*{Algorithm}
\noindent We will assume that the sequence $S$ given in the following
algorithm is sorted in decreasing order before being passed as an
argument. Should we need to make up for this assumption, ... yada yada

\begin{algorithm}
	\SetKwInOut{Input}{Input}
	\SetKwInOut{Output}{Output}
	\SetKw{KwDownTo}{down to}
	
	\Input{A sequence $S$ of coin denominators, sorted in decreasing order,
and a number $n$ of cents.}
	\Output{An ordered sequence of pairs, where the first element in each pair
denotes the denominator by its index in $S$, and the second element denotes
the amount required of that coin denominator.}
	\BlankLine
	
	$k = 1$\\
	$c = 0$\\
	Let $A$ be a new list
	
	\While{$k < S$.length}
	{
		\eIf{$n \geq S[k]$}
		{
			$c = c + 1$\\
			$n = n - S[k]$
		}
		{
			\If{$c \neq 0$}
			{
				$A$.append( ($k$, $c$) )\\
			}
			$c = 0$\\
			$k = k + 1$
		}
	}
	
	\Return $A$	
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection*{Proving the optimal solution}
\noindent Since our set of coin denominators $S$ are sorted in decreasing
order, we count $c$ the number of times
\\\\
\noindent \large{\textbf{b} Suppose that the available coins are in the
denominations that are powers of $c$, i.e., the denominations are $c^0$,
$c^1$,\dots, $c^k$ for some integers $c > 1$ and $k \geq 1$. Show that
the greedy algorithm always yields an optimal solution.}
% think c-nary representation, DiMS book as reference!
For any set of coin denominations given by $c^0$, $c^1$,\dots, $c^k$, where
$c > 1$ and $k \geq 1$, we observe that this forms the basis of a number
system. That is, the sum of all $c^i$ plus $1$ is equal to $c^{i+1}$, from
which it then follows that we can produce any number using a combination of
these denominators.

More formally, we state that
\begin{align}
	\sum_{i=0}^{j} c{_i}^{j} + 1 = c^{j+1}
\end{align}
And since we know that we can produce any number bounded by $c^k$, we must
now show that we can produce any number above this bound. We do this
inductively giving the base case
\begin{align}
	c^k + 1 &= c^0 + c^1 + \dots + c^k + 1\\
	&= 2c^0 + c^1 + \dots + c^k
\end{align}
which is above the bound previously mentioned bound, yet is still given by a
combination of the denominators. As we examine the inductive step, we observe
that we are simply counting on top, and adding this count to as coefficients
on any $c^i$, where $0 \leq i \leq k$, as shown below.
\begin{align}
	c^{k+1} &= \sum_{i=0}^{k}{a_i c_i} + ?\\
	&= \sum_{i=0}^{k+1}{a_i c_i} \nonumber
	\quad \text{, where $a_i$ is the amount we have of $c_i$}
\end{align}
It then follows by the induction, that we can produce any number.

\subsubsection*{A set that fails}
\large{Give a set of coin denominations for which the greedy algorithm
does not yield an optimal solution. Your set should include a penny, so
that there is a solution for every value of $n$.}
...

\subsubsection*{An $O(nk)$-time algorithm}
\large{Give an $O(nk)$-time algorithm that makes change for any set of $k$
different coin denominations, assuming that one of the coins is a penny.}
...
\begin{algorithm}
	\SetKwInOut{Input}{Input}
	\SetKwInOut{Output}{Output}
	\SetKw{KwDownTo}{down to}
	
	\Input{...}
	\Output{...}
	\BlankLine
	
	\Return $0$	
\end{algorithm}
